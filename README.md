# DatabaseGraph

Did it in colaboration with Cherry. I have some of the project, but only an SQL part (Ran out of space on my computer)

The data is imported into SQL, where it has been slightly renamed (Can be seen in the code for correct naming) 

The various execution times can be seen on the pictures
